## About Me :woman_technologist:
I'm a motivated junior iOS developer with a passion for crafting delightful mobile applications.

- :woman_office_worker: Former financial services professional with a background in team leadership and quality assurance.
- :seedling: I embarked on my Swift journey in September 2022 and completed RMIT Future Skills course "iOS App Development Foundations". Although delving into something entirely new was challenging, the experience was incredibly rewarding and I loved the problem solving and creative outlet. This fuelled my appetite for knowledge and I completed another iOS Development course offered by RMIT. Subsequently, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to participate in Bilue's iOS Academy for Women, taking another step in my ongoing learning journey.
- :zap: In my free time I have a passion for acquiring new knowledge. This often involves immersing myself in books focusing on health, science, and personal development. I also find joy in baking and decorating cakes üßÅ
